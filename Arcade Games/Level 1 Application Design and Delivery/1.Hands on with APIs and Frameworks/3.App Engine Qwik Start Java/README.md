## Overview

Google App Engine is a fully managed platform that allows developers to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure. The App Engine standard environment runs applications in secure, sandboxed containers on Googleâ€™s infrastructure, supporting several runtime environments including Java.

Key features of the App Engine standard environment include:  
- Persistent storage with querying, sorting, and transactions  
- Automatic scaling and load balancing to handle traffic demands  
- Asynchronous task queues for background work  
- Scheduled tasks for triggering events on a schedule  
- Integration with a wide range of Google Cloud services and APIs

This lab introduces you to deploying a simple Java web application to App Engine to demonstrate the ease of reliable application hosting and scaling.

## What This Lab Teaches

- Setting up a basic Java HTTP server application suitable for App Engine deployment  
- Downloading starter code from a GitHub repository (via Cloud Storage)  
- Deploying an application to Google App Engine using command-line tools  
- Viewing and interacting with your deployed App Engine app in a web browser

## Application Details

The sample Java application runs an HTTP server that responds on two endpoints:  
- `/` : Displays "Hello World!"  
- `/foo` : Displays "Foo!"

The server automatically determines the port from the App Engine environment or defaults to 8080 and handles requests using lightweight Java HTTP server classes.

## Key Concepts and Features

- **App Engine Standard Environment:** Provides a fully managed, containerized runtime with seamless scaling and high availability.  
- **Runtimes and APIs:** Supports multiple languages with preconfigured runtimes and includes built-in standard APIs for common application needs.  
- **Container-based hosting:** Your application runs inside isolated containers on Google's infrastructure, abstracting server management away.  
- **Automatic Scaling & Load Balancing:** App Engine dynamically adjusts the number of instances as traffic fluctuates.  
- **Persistent Storage & Background Processing:** Enables sophisticated applications with transactional Datastore, task queues, and cron jobs.

## Commands and Workflow Overview

- Use `gcloud storage cp` to download sample code from Cloud Storage to Cloud Shell.  
- Navigate to the Java app directory to inspect source code.  
- Deploy your app with:

```
gcloud app deploy
```

- View your running app in a browser with:
```
gcloud app browse
```

- Interact with app endpoints to verify successful deployment.

## What I Learned

- How Google App Engine simplifies deploying scalable Java web applications without manual infrastructure management.  
- The structure and features of the App Engine standard environment supporting containerized runtimes.  
- Using Google Cloud CLI tools (`gcloud`) to deploy and manage applications.  
- Basic Java HTTP server programming and handling multiple URL paths in a lightweight manner.  
- How App Engine automatically manages scalability, availability, and load balancing for your app.
